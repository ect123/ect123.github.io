So, after riding my first Crust Evasion frame for about 3-4 months, I came to terms with the fact that it was slightly too small for me. The Simworks Beatnik seatpost has an off-set of 20mm (I think), which put the framesize in the realm of possibility, but moving the saddle in the position farthest back caused the nose to point more upright than is comfortable for me. This was especially the case on rides more than 10 miles or so. A different seatpost and a new combination of stem and handlebars might have been enough to fix the issues, but I still felt that the frame alone was just a bit too dinky for me.

I'm 5' 9.5" with a body type that feels comfortable on my 56cm Surly Long Haul Trucker, even though I'm probably best fit for the elusive 55cm frame. I figured I'd cut my losses with the Evasion Medium and try and get my hands on the next release in Extra-Medium. I was a little nervous because they sold out of Extra-Mediums in a couple of hours in 2020. Plus, I really liked the raw frame and wasn't sure if they'd come in any other style that I would be able to live with. Thankfully I got one, and I'm really happy about the Galaxy finish. I just swapped all the build parts from the Medium frame, [listed here](crust-evasion-build). Just had to buy a new star-fangled nut.
