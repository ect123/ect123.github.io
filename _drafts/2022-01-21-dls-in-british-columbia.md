# Introduction

 <div id="map"></div>

Rectangular surveying of North America began in 1785 with the United States' Public Land Survey System (PLSS) and later in Canada in the 1840s. Canada's Dominion Land Survey (DLS) was meantto divide the land into sections and describe them to facilitate settlement. The typical landscape of British Columbia doesn't cooperate with normal methods for surveying. Unlike in the Canadian Prairie Provinces, where the horizon stays flat, BC's mountains were a barrier to on-the-ground efforts by new Canadians to inventory land resources. Surveying in BC, where straight lines are used to diagram a natural landscape, is a difficult process in the province's generally rugged terrain.

However, I recently came across a collection of about 1400 1/4 section surveys of BC on microfilm. These are reproductions of the original surveys and I believe they're only found at Library and Archives Canada. This set of maps

### May 16, 1871
Terms of the Union (between the colony of British Columbia and the Dominion of Canada) specified that BC would get a railway (in "Clause 11"[^1] of the terms) (page 2). The Dominion of Canada will start building a railroad within 2 years of the union between the colony of BC and the Dominion, to better connect BC and the Pacific with the rest of Canada. In return, the Dominion will be granted the land surrounding the railway (up to 20 miles buffer) to use as they wish to further the development of the railway, as long as it is public and not claimed by pre-emption or land grant. BC wont sell land between the time of the union and when the railway is constructed. The Dominion will pay BC an annual fee of $100,000 for their land to aid the construction on the railway.

[^1]: Clause 11: *The Government of the Dominion undertake to secure the commencement simultaneously, within two years from the date of the Union, of the construction of a railway from the Pacific towards the Rocky Mountains, and from such point as may be selected, east of the Rocky Mountains, towards the Pacific, to connect the seaboard of British Columbia with the railway system of Canada; and, further, to secure the completion of such railway within ten years from the date of the Union.*

### July 20, 1871
The union between BC and Canada happened on July 20, 1871, and construction of the railway would start within two years, and end no later than 10 years after their union (page 16).    

### July 18, 1874
The Province wanted to reserve some land near the potential terminus of the railway on Vancouver Island. The reserve was defined: 1874 - B.C. Gazette, July 18th, page 139 "a strip of land Twenty Miles in width along the Eastern Coast of Vancouver Island between Seymour Narrows and the Harbour of Esquimalt, is hereby reserved."

### April 22, 1875
Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway Act of 1875 [^2] -  Act to authorize the grant of certain public lands to the Government of Canada, for railway purposes. Stated that Esquimalt would be the terminus. 

The Dominion couldn't get a good guarantee from potential contractors (the Vancouver Land and Railway Co. (Lewis Clement) and the Victoria, Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway Co. (Robert Dunsmuir)), even though they had initiated a bill to have the railway constructed, so it was delayed (page 4). In the meantime, settlers moved in and expected a land grant.

### May 8, 1880

Railway Lands Act [^3]

[^3]: [Chapter 11 S.B.C. 1880](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/hstats/hstats/1123152022)

### February 16, 1881 
Canadian Pacific Railway Company formed.

### April 21, 1882
E & N Railway Act was repealed [^4].

[^4]: [Chapter 16 S.B.C. 1882](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/hstats/hstats/775723350)

### June 14, 1883
The 1874 Gazetted Reserve was recinded and replaced. A Reserve on a tract bounded by: "On the South, by a straight line drawn from the head of Saanich Inlet to Muir Creek, on the Straits of Fuca; On the West, by a straight line drawn from Muir Cree, aforesaid, to Crown Mountain; On the North by a straight line drawn from Crown Mountain towards Seymour Narrows, to the 50th parallel of latitude, to a point on the coast opposite Cape Mudge; and On the East, by the coast line of Vancouver Island to the point of commencement."

### August 28, 1883
August 28th, 1883 the Dominion secured Dunsmuir and Associates (E & N Railway Company) to complete the railway by June 10, 1887.

### Dcember 19, 1883
An Act relating to the Island Railway [^5], the Graving Dock and
Railway Lands of the Province (known as the Settlement Act), outlined the boundaries of land to be transferred to the Dominion by the Province. It also outlined the lands which would stay private (and the rights to natural resources they had). Also said that pre-emptors were only to get surface rights (not coal or timber or base metals). 

From 1871 until 1884, settlers in the Railway Reserve could not be issued Land Grants, but were issued pre-emption records. The Dominion "Patents" reserved all the base metals and coal to the Crown and
gave the E & N Railway the right to take land for right of way or station grounds, without
payment of compensation.  

"Surveys had been proceeding under provincial sponsorship. Copies of the plans were turned over to the Dominion Government and in 1886 the Dominion began issuing Patents to lands in Nelson, Cranberry, Quamichan, Cowichan, Comiaken, Shawnigan, Chemainus, Alberni,
Newcastle, Cedar and Comox Districts" (page 6).

[^5]: [Chapter 14 S.B.C. 1884](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/hstats/hstats/1003191769)

### November 7, 1885
The western and eastern railway segments were joined at Craigellachie, B.C.

### February 10, 1904

The Vancouver Island Settlers' Rights Act [^6] gave the settlers their full rights of the land if they could show proof that they had occupied them prior to The Settlement Act of 1884. E & N Railway Company appealed the courts, then after that didn't work, approached the Province about acquiring land "in lieu of those alienation under the 1904 Settlers' Rights Act".

NOTES:
May 16, 1871: Terms of the Union (between the colony of British Columbia and the Dominion of Canada) specified that BC would get a railway (in "Clause 11" of the terms) (page 2). The union between BC and Canada happened on July 20, 1871, and construction of the railway would start within two years, and end no later than 10 years after their union (page 16).    
**Clause 11:**     
*The Government of the Dominion undertake to secure the commencement
simultaneously, within two years from the date of the Union, of the construction of
a railway from the Pacific towards the Rocky Mountains, and from such point as
may be selected, east of the Rocky Mountains, towards the Pacific, to connect
the seaboard of British Columbia with the railway system of Canada; and, further,
to secure the completion of such railway within ten years from the date of the
Union.*

[The Dominion of Canada will start building a railroad within 2 years of the union between the colony of BC and the Dominion, to better connect BC and the Pacific with the rest of Canada.]

*And the Government of British Columbia agree to convey to the Dominion
Government, in trust, to be appropriated in such a manner as the Dominion
Government, may deem advisable in furtherance of the construction of the said
railway, throughout its entire length in British Columbia (not to exceed, however,
twenty (20) miles on each side of the said line) as may be appropriated for the
same purpose by the Dominion Government from the public lands in the Northwest Territory and the Province of Manitoba: **Provided that the quantity of land
which may be held under pre-emption right or by Crown grant within the limits of
the tract of land in British Columbia to be so conveyed to the Dominion
Government shall be made good to the Dominion from contiguous public lands**;
and provided further that until the commencement, within two years, as aforesaid, from the date of the Union, of the construction of the said railway, the Government of British Columbia shall not sell or alienate any further portions of the public lands of British Columbia in any other way than under right
of pre-emption, requiring actual residence of the pre-emptor on the land claimed
by him. In consideration of the land to be so conveyed in aid of the construction
of the railway, the Dominion Government agree to pay to British Columbia, from
the date of the Union, the sum of 100,000 dollars per annum, in half-yearly
payments in advance.*
[In return, the Dominion will be granted the land surrounding the railway (up to 20 miles buffer) to use as they wish to further the development of the railway, as long as it is public and not claimed by pre-emption or land grant. BC wont sell land between the time of the union and when the railway is constructed. The Dominion will pay BC an annual fee of $100,000 for their land to aid the construction on the railway.]

The E & N Railway act was repealed in 1882 (Chapter 16 S.B.C. 1882), and a new reserve was created: 1883 - B.C. Gazette June 14th, page 192 - a Reserve on a tract bounded by:
 "On the South, by a straight line drawn from the head of Saanich Inlet to Muir Creek, on the Straits of Fuca; On the West, by a straight line drawn from Muir Cree, aforesaid, to Crown Mountain; On the North by a straight line drawn from Crown Mountain towards Seymour Narrows, to the 50th parallel of latitude, to a point on the coast opposite Cape Mudge; and On the East, by the coast line of Vancouver Island to the point of commencement."

August 28th, 1883 the Dominion secured Dunsmuir and Associates (E & N Railway Company) to complete the railway by June 10, 1887.

1884 - Chapter 14 S.B.C. - An Act relating to the Island Railway, the Graving Dock and
Railway Lands of the Province (known as the Settlement Act), outlined the boundaries of land to be transferred to the Dominion by the Province. It also outlined the lands which would stay private (and the rights to natural resources they had). Also said that pre-emptors were only to get surface rights (not coal or timber or base metals).

E & N Railway Company appealed the courts, then after that didn't work, approached the Province about acquiring land "in lieu of those alienation under the 1904 Settlers' Rights Act".
